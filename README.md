Hi! I'm Denis (or Saharoc) â€” a Linux enthusiast and developer from Russia.

ðŸ’¡ My focus:
- Python (3+ years of experience)
- C++ (currently diving into it)
- Socket programming and low-level networking
- Linux systems, scripting, and automation
- Competitive programming â€” my foundation and passion

ðŸŽ® I enjoy unconventional games like HoMM3 HotA, console-based classics, and anything that challenges the mind.

ðŸŽ¯ Currently exploring backend development â€” aiming to build scalable, secure, and elegant systems.
